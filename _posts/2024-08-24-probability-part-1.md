# Probability Part 1 (Motivation, Counting Methods, Basic Principles)

## Why do we study probability theory?
We live in a world full of uncertainty. Yet, we still have to decide those uncertainties. For example, when COVID-19 hit the world during 2019-2022, we had to decide whether to take a vaccine. Given the statistical facts of several vaccines, how can we ensure that the vaccine is really effective or not? In this high-stakes situation, managing risk is really important because it involves our single and precious life.

That's where probability theory comes to mind. Probability theory is a science of uncertainty that we can quantify to help us make some decisions. Other situations or questions that may need a probability theory to answer include:
- Should we make an investment in this oil field?
- Should we lockdown the country to contain the spread of COVID-19?
- Should we build this new road?

That was in real life. How about in ML/AI specifically? Together with Linear Algebra and Calculus/Optimization, they play a crucial role. Many ML and AI approaches are based on probabilistic methods. For example:
- Classification/Regression: logistic regression, Bayesian classifier
- Clustering: gaussian mixture models, latent Dirichlet allocation
- Image Generation: variational autoencoder and diffusion models rely heavily on probabilistic models (let's discuss it in another post!)
